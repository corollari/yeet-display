## Why?
Yes.

## How?
1. Fit an arduino with a A4988 shield and connect a bipolar stepper motor to it
2. Take a thin, translucent and flat object and attach it to the motor's axis at in a slanted position (in our case it was 38ยบ). We did this by gluing a piece of wood to the translucent object and drilling a hole in it, through which we put the motor's axis
3. Hold an standard projector above the abomination just created to project some images on the slanted screen
4. Make it spin

## Who?
